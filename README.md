This addon allows a user to toggle referers between 3 states:
Referer 0: Never send the Referer header or set document.referrer
Referer 1: Send the Referer header when clicking on a link, and set
document.referrer for the following page
Referer 2: Send the Referer header when clicking on a link or loading an image,
and set document.referrer for the following page. (Default)

It has a quick toggle mode using the right mouse button or you can use the left
mouse button to bring up a menu and select the referer that way.

The icon changes based on the current referer.

Referer 0 == red
Referer 1 == yellow
Referer 2 == green
